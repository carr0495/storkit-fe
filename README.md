I built this app with the idea of giving people a place to talk about sotcks and crypto-currencies. This project is still a work in progress with plans to include:

- Popular post highlight
- ability to switch between stock market chat and Crypto chat
- a live chat section for people to discuss daily plays
- tags for stock categories (penny stocks, DD, Catalyst etc..)
- like comments and delete comments

# Thanks for looking!
